I'm aneesh (pronouns: he/him)! Currently figuring out where I'll be starting my PhD journey next fall :D

Previously:
  + [bodo.ai](https://bodo.ai) working on a compiler for transforming SQL and pandas workloads into fast, scalable, distributed programs
  + [KatanaGraph](https://github.com/KatanaGraph/) working on a distributed graph mining engine/building a scalable distributed graph database
  + [Qumulo](https://qumulo.com/) working on distributed filesystems

I like learning things and playing around with technology - poke around my repositories to see what I'm currently interested in!
