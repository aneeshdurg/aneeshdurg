I'm aneesh (pronouns: he/him)! Currently a developer at [bodo.ai](https://bodo.ai) working on a compiler for transforming SQL and pandas workloads into fast, scalable, distributed programs!

I like learning things and playing around with technology - poke around my repositories to see what I'm currently interested in!
