I'm aneesh (pronouns: he/him)! Currently a developer at [KatanaGraph](https://github.com/KatanaGraph) where I work on designing and implementing novel algorithms for a fast, scalable subgraph pattern matcher for a graph database that implements [OpenCypher](https://github.com/OpenCypher/OpenCypher)!

I like learning things and playing around with technology - poke around my repositories to see what I'm currently interested in!
